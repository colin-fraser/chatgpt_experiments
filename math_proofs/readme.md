The statement "And since a^2 and 2b^2 are equal, they must have the same final decimal digit" is not true in general. For example, consider a = 5 and b = 2, so that a^2 = 25 and 2b^2 = 16. Here, the final decimal digit of a^2 is 5, while the final digit of 2b^2 is 6.

The correct statement should be "And since a^2 and 2b^2 have the same final decimal digit, they must be congruent modulo 10". In other words, the final digit of a^2 determines the final digit of 2b^2, and vice versa. This implication is valid because the only possible final digits of a perfect square are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9, and the only possible final digit of twice a square is 2, 8, or 0 (depending on the final digit of the square).

Once this correction is made, the proof is complete and correct.</td></tr>

It uses a proof by contradiction, assuming that √2 can be written as a ratio of two coprime integers and then showing that this leads to a contradiction. The contradiction arises from the fact that a^2 and 2b^2 have different final decimal digits, which implies that a^2 and b^2 are both divisible by 10, contradicting the assumption that a/b was in lowest terms. Therefore, the assumption that √2 can be written as a ratio of two coprime integers must be false, and √2 is irrational.</td></tr>
